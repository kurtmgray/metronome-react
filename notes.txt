Flow:
	init() 
		establishes audio context and a Worker instance
		sets a listener (.onmessage) to call scheduler() when "tick" is posted by the worker
		postMessage {"interval": lookahead} to the worker, worker uses as interval 
			to postMessage("tick") for calls of scheduler() to occur

	play()
		handles "locked" audio on some browsers
		toggles isPlaying - play() also handles stopping
		if isPlaying, 
			set currentSubdivision at 0
			set nextNoteTime to right now
			send "start" to Worker
				worker setInterval starts postMessaging "tick" to trigger scheduler() calls
		if !isPlaying (clicked again to stop)
			send "stop to worker"
				worker clears the interval and sets ID to null

	scheduler()
		while there are notes that are already scheduled (nextNoteTime) to play before
			now and the scheduleAheadTime
			scheduleNote(), passing currentSubdivision and the nextNoteTime
				scheduleNote() processes which subdivision we are on, 
			also call nextNote()
				which sets nextNoteTime based on the selected resolution and tempo

	nextNote()
		sets nextNoteTime based on the selected resolution and tempo
		loops to 0.. currentSubdivision 12 or 16 is treated as beat 1 by the oscillator


Things to implement:
	- All subdivisions playing at once
	- Volume control on each subdivision (and beat 1 accent)
	
	- 16th play only e's and a's
	- 8th play only +'s
	
	- Overall volume control - overall gain node?
	- Display the current beat number

	- Tap/Click to set tempo
	
	Tone.js?
	
	- Different sound schemes
		(load via different sources?)

	
	Program -> Preset
		Be able to store in memory (LS fine)
		Program contains presets, has a Title
		Preset contains info about:
			tempo,
			time signature,
			subdivision,
			volume,
			sound scheme,
			number of loops before stopping or moving to next preset,
		Be able to Play a Program once through or Repeat it
		Be able to reduce the number of clicks in the entire program (half notes)
		Be able to designate a Preset as a countoff, and not reduce the number of clicks 
		Be able to edit a Preset
		Be able to insert a Preset in a specific place (create Preset, edit Program)

	UX
		Met on load
		Memory -> login
		Write -> compose loops
		Mute -> mute all sounds
		Tap -> tap tempo
		Start/Stop

	React
		Sliders to correct position on preset change (?)
		Tempo and Gain numbers reflect preset change (easy)
        Measure number (in programMode)
		Create preset page
			preset is auto created in its own program
			add preset to existing program option
		Edit preset page

	Issues:
		(SOLVED) subdivisions become out of sync when speeding up tempo
			solution to have 5 separate oscillators?
			maybe solved when loading sounds differently?
			(SOLUTION)
				run a single osc with a single call to schedule 12lets
				divide by 12 for Q, 6 for E, 4 for T, 3 for Q, mute all others
					can do 8 for HNT and 2 for TS
		(SOLVED) beat display goes past the set beats per measure if changed at a particular time
            (SOLUTION) current subdivision was > than bpm * 12, so used >= at 233
        Measure volume not working, measure gain controlled by quarter gain

		React
		(IMPROVED)Errors on change volume, long time playing.
			(SOLUTION) increase lookahead and delay start time, still not perfect when dragging slider

		Time Signature changes have no effect

		(SOLVED)Call a function to stop Tone.Transport once the program is done playing.
			(SOLUTION) used Tone.Transport.schedule() to schedule stop() and dispatch() using runningTotalMeasures

		(SOLVED) Setting bpm per loop
			(SOLUTION) used Tone.Transport.schedule() to schedule the changes at particular measures
    
    Down the road
        handle mixed meter

	Implement BrowserRouter? REST style routing?

	EDIT program
		basically just order of presets, using DND
	EDIT preset
		use tempPresetValues for selected preset?
		use activePreset to store preset ID, filter through presets to update




TODO TOMORROW:
